                <p> this site uses UX personas and storyboarding to 
                    explore how users interact with an interface, utilizing the 
                    self-checkout at cvs as a case study.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="cvs-header">
            <h2>interface: the cvs self-checkout</h2>
            </div>
 
            <div class="cvs">
                
                    <p> i observed the self-checkout interface at the cvs on thayer. 
                        this interface allows users to check out without waiting in line for the single 
                        cashier. there is a welcome screen proceeded by a virtual receipt that appears when the user 
                        begins scanning items. additionally, there is a card reader that allows users to pay with chip, insert 
                        swipe, or tap. the entire console is fairly compact and involves minimal tacticle engagement for maximum efficiency. 
                        this interface is trying to allow more users to check-out with relative speed. 
                        </p>

            <div class = "questions">
                <p> observing this interface, i developed a few key questions: </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        Are the buttons intuitive without additional signage/type? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do the images associated with each button impact usability? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do verbal instructions impact your experience? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is the scanning mechanism intuitive? Do the directions add additional value? 
                    </li>
                   <li>
                        How often do you need additional assistance? How accessible is it to request help? 
                   </li>
                   <li>
                        How do the supplementary sounds and lights impact your experience? Are they distracting or helpful in guiding you through the work? 
                   </li>

                </ul>
                </div>
            <div class = "observations">
                <p>i observed three people interacting with this interface: </p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
                    <tr>
                      <th>Person 1</th>
                      <th>Person 2</th>
                      <th>Person 3</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td> This person had many items and moved quickly through the purchasing process </td>
                        <td> This person had only one item and seemed to be moving with haste </td>
                      <td> This person used the phone number look up at the start of the process and seemed to be familiar with the interface</td>
            
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>All of the items were of similar sizes/functions (beverages) so the scanning process was relatively smooth</td>
                      <td>This person was very familiar with the interface so she did not await any verbal instructions</td>
                      <td>This person set up the bag before he began scanning his items</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>This person wanted to use cash, but resorted to tap-to-pay because cash was not an option</td>
                        <td>This person used tap to pay, but did so before the interface was ready so had to wait for a moment</td>
                        <td>This person paid with card and waited for instructions to insert chip</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>This person scanned all of their items first and left them on the scale, then bagged them at the end of the interaction which slowed down the process</td>
                        <td>This person didn’t bag her single item and checked out rather quickly</td>
                        <td>This person scanned and bagged multiple items with relative ease</td>
                      </tr>
                  </table>
                <p>the answers to the aforementioned questions have been summarized below:</p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
                    <tr>
                      <th>Person 1</th>
                      <th>Person 2</th>
                      <th>Person 3</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td> This person finds scanning and bagging multiple items to be un-intuitive however it was not difficult for him to learn</td>                  
                        <td> She is very familiar with the interface and does not think about it visually at all, and instead interacts based on instinct (automatically start scanning, presses buttons, then taps to pay)</td>
                      <td> He doesn’t think a lot about the buttons but imagines it would be confusing for someone who isn’t familiar because they are hard to read</td>
            
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>He never uses the voiceover but does find the sound somewhat distracting </td>
                      <td>She finds the sounds played somewhat annoying as she comes here often for quick purchases </td>
                      <td>He ignores the voiceover though imagines it would be helpful for someone with vision impairment</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>He never asks for additional help but sometimes is forced into contact with the cashier if he is scanning cough syrup or really struggling with the scanning mechanism </td>
                        <td>She never asks for help or needs it</td>
                        <td>While the interface is relatively simple, he acknowledges that the various shades of blue + unhelpful images may impair the accessibility of this interface                         </td>
                      </tr>
                  </table>
                <p> key takeaways: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While this interface is not very different from most self check out options, it did seem that it rewarded people who already understood its rhythm </li>
                    <li>Most users seem to value effiency, as they come to this CVS for quick errands often</li>
                    <li>Most people seemed to ignore the voiceover / did not wait for its verbal instructions </li>
                    <li>Because it was somewhat crowded, there seemed to be a general sense of annoyance at the line and perhaps interface, as it does not reward speed </li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class = "personas">
                <p> from these observations, i created two personas that embody most users' needs:</p>
                <div id = "personas-compared">
                    <img src = "personas-compared.jpg" width = 700px height = auto >
                </div>
                <br>
                <div id = "personas-charts">
                    <img src = "persona-1.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                    <img src = "persona-2.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                </div>
                <p> with this persona, harry, i created a storyboard which encapsulates the user experience of this interface: </p>
                <div id = "storyboard" >
                    <img src = "storyboard-1.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                    <img src = "storyboard-2.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                </div>
                <p> thank you for reading my storyboard! i hope you understand this interface a little bit better :) </p>
